# Discrete Optimization: Genetic Algorithms, Bin-Packing.  <br>

Dr. Stephane Dedieu. January-Feb. 2023. 

<br>
The initial motivation for this work: develop a multi-objective optimization methodology for a pseudo-adaptive algorithm
that assigns IoT devices to a set of networks.<br>
We assume an assessment of each network available to each device in terms of resources, QoS, and a Genetic Algorithm running on a central controller to sense, analyze and
optimally allocate networks’ resources among a set of devices. An original bin-packing algorithm is used for local convergence.  <br>

# Discrete Optimization: Genetic Algorithms, Bin-Packing.  <br>

Stephane Dedieu. January-Feb. 2023. 

<br>
The initial motivation for this work: develop a multi-objective optimization methodology for a pseudo-adaptive algorithm
that assigns IoT devices to a set of networks.<br>
We assume an assessment of each network available to each device in terms of resources, QoS, and a Genetic Algorithm running on a central controller to sense, analyze and
optimally allocate networksâ€™ resources among a set of devices. An original bin-packing algorithm is used for local convergence.  <br>
<br>
At the moment this repository contains the copy of an article, with preliminary activities, presented at the IEEE conference in Quebec city - Canada in 2018. <br> 
All codes for this project are programmed with Matlab. Most of sources are confidential.  We will reprogram a subset of the algorithms with Python. And present the methodology with a simplified problem.
